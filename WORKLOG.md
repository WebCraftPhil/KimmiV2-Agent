## Completed Work

| Date       | Item                                                                      | Notes |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| 2025-10-26 | Drafted `PROJECTOVERVIEW.md` with end-to-end architecture and action plan | Establishes target system design and immediate steps. |
| 2025-10-30 | Created `AGENTS.md` documenting agent roles, prompt rules, and change mgmt | Captures chaining logic and global prompting standards. |
| 2025-10-30 | Provisioned OpenRouter API key (`moonshotai/kimi-dev-72b:free`) in `.env`   | Default model updated across code and env templates. |
| 2025-10-30 | Produced this `WORKLOG.md` to track progress and outstanding work          | Centralizes delivery status, decisions, and risks. |
| 2025-10-30 | Wired turn-level JSON logging to `data/logs/` via API layer                | Ensures each agent response is persisted for observability. |

## In Progress

- Establish initial agent runtime (`openai.js` + orchestrator) that honors the documented chaining sequence.

## Backlog & Next Steps

1. Create GitHub repository `kimmi-v2-openrouter` and set up CI scaffold.
2. Verify OpenRouter smoke test using `api/openrouter_api.py`.
3. Build `agent_core/orchestrator.py` with memory placeholder and MCP registry hooks.
4. Scaffold the Next.js web client with chat, JSON viewer, and memory panel components.
5. Implement and register the first MCP server (Notion read/write).
6. Execute end-to-end integration test: prompt → model → MCP → JSON → UI.
7. Convert successful test runs into content artifacts for MoneyMaven.blog.

## Open Issues & Risks

- `openai.js` does not yet exist; agent prompts must be implemented to enforce documented rules.
- No MCP servers configured; tool layer remains theoretical until registry integration lands.
- Absence of automated schema validation could allow malformed JSON to reach the UI.

## Decision Log

- 2025-10-30: Adopted four-step agent chain (summarize → ideas → hooks → performance) as the baseline pipeline.
- 2025-10-30: Standardized fallback response `"No idea generated – retry later."` for recovery scenarios.

## Notes for Future Updates

- Log all prompt or orchestration changes here with the date, owner, and rationale.
- Record integration test results (pass/fail) and known issues after each major run.
