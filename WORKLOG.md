## Completed Work

| Date       | Item                                                                                 | Notes |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| 2025-10-26 | Drafted `PROJECTOVERVIEW.md` with end-to-end architecture and action plan            | Establishes target system design and immediate steps. |
| 2025-10-30 | Authored `AGENTS.md` + `CURSOR_RULES.md` documenting agent roles and prompting rules | Defines global contracts for the four-step pipeline. |
| 2025-10-30 | Provisioned OpenRouter defaults (`moonshotai/kimi-dev-72b:free`) in env templates    | Keeps model selection centralized via env vars. |
| 2025-10-30 | Implemented agent core: orchestrator, memory store, MCP registry, content chain      | `agent_core/` now operational with JSON validation + logging. |
| 2025-10-30 | Exposed FastAPI service + OpenRouter client (`/run_agent`, `/health`)                | Turn-level logs stored in `data/logs/`; error handling wired. |
| 2025-10-30 | Scaffolded Next.js console with chat UI + JSON viewers                               | `/pages/index.tsx` interacts with backend through `/api/agent`. |
| 2025-10-31 | Pinned runtime guides and Docker base image to Python 3.11/3.12                      | Ensures local and container builds avoid missing 3.13 wheels. |
| 2025-10-30 | Refreshed README, env guidance, and runtime directories (`.gitkeep`)                 | Documents setup for backend, frontend, MCP registry, Docker. |

## In Progress

- Validate OpenRouter access for the default model and capture first successful end-to-end transcript.

## Backlog & Next Steps

1. Add real MCP integrations (Notion, TikTok, Ideogram) and document their contracts.
2. Implement automated schema tests for chain outputs and agent responses.
3. Introduce CI workflows (lint, tests, type-check) once the repo moves to GitHub.
4. Extend orchestrator for multi-agent dispatch or streaming responses.
5. Package deployment scripts (Render/Vercel/DO) and add auth/billing scaffolds.

## Open Issues & Risks

- `openai.js` (or equivalent JS orchestrator) still pending—ensure prompt templates stay in sync when added.
- OpenRouter model `moonshotai/kimi-dev-72b:free` returned 404 during smoke test; confirm provider availability or select fallback.
- MCP layer only includes a demo tool; production-grade connectors (Notion, TikTok, etc.) remain unimplemented.
- No automated regression tests yet; JSON regressions could slip without schema validation.

## Decision Log

- 2025-10-30: Adopted the four-step content ideation chain as the baseline agent workflow.
- 2025-10-30: Standardized fallback response `"No idea generated – retry later."` for recovery scenarios.

## Notes for Future Updates

- Record each MCP tool addition and prompt change here with date + owner.
- Log every end-to-end run (success/failure) once OpenRouter access is confirmed.
